        Over the years, I’ve worked on projects that mean a lot to me, from small experiments to bigger milestones. Some projects are all about passion, others are happy accidents that turn into something bigger. This is my little corner to share what’s brought me joy, sparked creativity, and maybe even made an impact.

              Being a Microsoft MVP means I’ve spent years geeking out, sharing knowledge, and contributing to the tech community. Apparently, they like it enough to keep giving it to me, for which I am obviously very grateful.
